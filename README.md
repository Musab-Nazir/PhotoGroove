Elm SPA made while going through the [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) book

## Build
```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --optimize --output=app.js
```

## Run
Have a http server running that serves the static `index.html` file.
I used [http-server-spa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server-spa)
